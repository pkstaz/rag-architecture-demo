# Tenants

## Folder Structure

Tenant resources are expected to utilize the following folder structure:

```
tenants/<tenant-name>/<resource-category>/base
tenants/<tenant-name>/<resource-category>/overlays/<cluster>
```

For Example:

```sh
tenants/
└── my-team
    ├── namespaces
    │   ├── base
    │   └── overlays
    │       ├── my-cluster-1
    │       └── my-cluster-2
    └── rbac
        ├── base
        └── overlays
            └── my-cluster-2
```

The `tenant-name` should be a logical name used for grouping assets that belong to a specific group or team.  `tenant-name` will most commonly correspond to a team name.

The `resource-category` can be any logical grouping of resources that you wish to deploy together.  How you wish to group your resources should be flexible based on your organizations needs.

The `cluster` should correspond to the resources you wish to deploy to that specific cluster.  If you do not include a cluster in the overlay, those resources will not be synced to that cluster.

## ApplicationSet

Tenant resources synced by ArgoCD Application that is generated by the following ApplicationSet:

[tenant-applicationset](../components/argocd/apps/base/tenants-applicationset.yaml)

This ApplicationSet uses a git generator to find folders with the correct cluster in the overlays.  An application is created for each combination of tenant and resource-category that is available for that cluster.

```yaml
spec:
  generators:
  - git:
      directories:
        - path: tenants/*/*/overlays/my-cluster-1
```

The example above will generate the following applications on my-cluster-1 and my-cluster-2.

my-cluster-1:

```
my-team-namespaces
my-team-rbac
```

my-cluster-2:

```
my-team-namespaces
```
